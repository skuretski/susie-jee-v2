*Edit: this post was written on March 9, 2021 before the events in Georgia. I was wary to post it, but I think now might 
be a good time. My heart is currently broken. Everything feels so heavy. The weight of racism for BIPOC is just... tiring.*

Since March 2020 (the beginning of America's COVID tale), racism and violence towards Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders 
has increased. [Time Magazine](https://time.com/5938482/asian-american-attacks/), 
[PBS](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/watch-live-how-to-address-the-surge-of-anti-asian-hate-crimes), 
[Yale](https://insights.som.yale.edu/insights/how-american-mythologies-fuel-anti-asian-violence) and various other outlets 
have reported similar findings. This makes me very upset, but again not surprised. America, even before the Revolutionary 
War, was founded on oppressive ideologies. If you disagree with me, please ask any North American Indigenous person. 

I wrote an unpublished piece back in June 2020 about racism against Asians. At the time, I did not want to detract from 
Black Lives Matter, George, Rayshard, Breonna, and countless others. It wasn't about me. The spotlight should be on the Black 
community and amplifying the message - No Justice, No Peace. To this day and forever, I will fiercely support equity, justice, 
prosperity, and peace for Black people.

I felt guilty for vocalizing racism against Asian Americans. I don't get pulled over for DWB. I don't get followed in stores. 
I don't get shot at by the police in broad daylight. But that doesn't mean I don't experience racism. It doesn't mean my hurt 
soul is any less valid.

## COVID Times

When COVID-19 first was breaking out, I was still taking the CTA into work. I was legimately nervous about being on the bus 
being Asian American. I heard stories of other Asians getting harassed because of coronavirus. It wouldn't matter if I'm Korean. 
It wouldn't matter if I was Malaysian. Because to many white Americans, "all Asians look the same" despite the rich, beautiful, and 
diverse cultures of Asia. It didn't help that our then President would refer to COVID-19 as "Kung Flu" or "China Virus." He just added 
fuel to the fire, and those who don't think his words were meaningful obviously have never felt uncomfortable or in danger 
because of their race in their everyday lives.

## Growing Up Surrounded by Whiteness

As an adoptee, I grew up in a very white area. There was not a lot of diversity, so as a result, I was whitewashed. My 
Korean culture was backseated. From the earliest time I can remember, I knew I looked different, but I acted the same, right? 
I talked the same. I dressed the same. I ate the same things. But that didn't stop racism. Children would pull their eyes 
back and make fun of me. I would get called "Chink" or referred to as "Ching Chong." As a child I didn't make a fuss about it 
because: 1) Kids make fun of each other, right? 2) I was not technically Chinese, so they were wrong and stupid. 3) I was a 
good student, and I don't make fusses. 4) I just want to fit in. 

Throughout grade school and high school, I operated in a mode that can only be described as "just be as white as possible." 
It was the only mode I knew. Dress in the latest Delia's or Abercrombie. Eat pizza in the cafeteria. Listen to the lastest 
boy bands. It was the epitome of most white teenagers in the 2000's. Despite this, I couldn't help but feel like an outsider 
all the time. I don't think any boys liked me. My mom would tell me it was because I was intimidating. And maybe that was 
true. I wasn't a super girly girl. I spent some weekends on the Navy base doing things like shooting guns 
and learning how to put a fire out on a ship. Of course, I'm not attributing all my angsty, lonely teenage years on race. 
I don't discount that I was an odd duck in high school. But, it does leave me wonder if my white community just didn't 
know what to do with a Korean-looking, white-acting person. Because I certainly didn't know what to do.

I do remember distinctly when a shred of my Korean-ness came to light. This was during Model UN my junior year. I chose 
Republic of Korea. I figured it was a great way to learn more Korean history and investigate their pressing international 
matters. My mom and I found a wonderful woman who sewed a 한복 (hanbok) for me to wear on the two days of the big event. It was 
red and white with a 고름 (goreum) that was the color of the ROK flag. The day of model UN came. I was so excited to wear my 
very own 한복. Then, my partner showed up wearing a kimono. My heart sank. If anyone knows the history of Japanese occupation 
in Korea, please think of how this looks and feels to me. I continued on with Model UN as if it were fine because I just 
wanted to fit in. Not make a stir. 

## College

I chose a predominantly white, small liberal arts college. In hindsight, I wish I had chosen a large, city university. 
But, here I was in the middle of cornfield town Illinois. Again, I just operated in the only mode I knew: just be as 
white as possible. I made a few Asian friends along the way who invited me to Asian student clubs. I always declined. I'd say 
I was too busy, but I was just avoiding conversations like this: 

- Them: "Oh, so you're Korean?" 
- Me: "Yep."
- Them: "I love Korean food. What's your favorite?"
- Me: "Uhh, I'm adopted."
- Them: "But you don't know any Korean food?"
- Me: "Uhh, no."

I survived college in a nice, little protected bubble where we didn't talk about race.

## Adult and Professional Life

### Young Adult Life
By growing up in a mostly white area and going to college at a mostly white school, I, to no surprise, had mostly white 
friends. However, I did befriend a Korean girl in my 20's. She was like the Korean sister I never had. We would explore Korean 
places, and she was so patient with me. I barely knew how to use chopsticks. I eventually got to know some of her friends who 
were mostly Korean and Asian. All of them, except one, were very friendly and understood I was a Korean adoptee. That one, however, 
made fun of me for not knowing Korean and how to order food. This was the first time I felt so ashamed for not knowing my 
heritage, not knowing my language. I didn't fit as Korean. How could I claim to be Korean, but not know how to say anything? 
I felt like an outsider. I was neither Korean, nor white. To this day, I still feel this way. Where do I belong?


### Nursing 
I graduated college and became an ICU nurse in the area I grew up in. This was the first time in my life when I had to 
actually confront racism head on from strangers. This is the first time in my life when I had to interact with the public. As an ICU 
nurse, I would take care of people from all walks of life because illness knows no bounds. Here's a list of some overt 
instances of racism and microaggressions:
- Family or patient requesting a white nurse only or being referred to as a "Gook bitch"
- Being told by patients that I looked like someone they slept with in the war
- Being called by fellow Asian (not Korean) colleagues' names from people who I'd worked with for years because we sorta 
"looked the same"
- When dressed in scrubs and clearly visible as a health care worker, asked if I actually spoke English because I would not 
respond to them immediately because I might have been on the phone with a physician

This definitely was an eye opener to me. No one knew who I was. No one knew I was an adoptee. No one knew I actually grew 
up in their town. I was only seen for what I was on the outside: Korean, or to some, an Asian go-back-to-your-country bitch. 


### Tech
Tech has its own microecosystem of racism and sexism. And yes, I've experienced both personally in tech. But that will be another 
post to come about the intersectionality of racism and sexism... 


### Parting Thoughts

- Asian Americans includes ALL people from Asia, meaning not only East Asia (China, Korea, Japan), but also Southeast Asia and 
the Indian subcontinent.
- The history of the United States to Asian Americans is not kind. Vincent Chin, Japanese internment camps, various acts 
limiting or excluding citizenship or voting, the Patriot Act. 
- Model minority mentality is harmful.
- Microaggressions add up over time.
- Breonna. Say her name still.
- No justice. No peace.
- It was a hate crime.
- Bad days and addiction are not excuses for murder.

Signing off,

The Korean, this-is-my-country-too, bitch
