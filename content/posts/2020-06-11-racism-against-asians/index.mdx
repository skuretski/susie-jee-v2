excerpt: Over a month ago, we started shelter-in-place due to coronavirus. Around that time, I was pretty anxious. I was worried about loved ones, health care workers, getting coronavirus, job security, going back to working as a nurse, and how the federal & state governments were going (or not going to) respond.

# Brief History

I was adopted when I was an infant. I flew from South Korea to Chicago at almost 5 months old. I grew up in a very 
white community. I went to college in a very white community. I was a nurse in very white communities. 
Now, I live in Chicago where it's nice to see color, and I'm less likely to be noticing BIPOC (Black, Indigenous and People of Color) 
actively. If you're a BIPOC, you probably know what I mean. You make an eye glance at the other non-white person 
in some sort of unspoken solidarity. At least I do. Maybe people think I'm creepy AF. 

# Racism Towards Me

I grew up in a pretty sheltered community. It was on the outskirts of suburbs and bordering rural. There was very little diversity. 
So naturally, I was the one who stuck out a bit. As a kid, I would get addressed by "ching chong" or kids would slant their eyes 
at me. As I got to be a little older, it would get more sophisticated with "chink" or "gook." Usually, these slurs would come from 
people I didn't know. Most of my friends and acquaintances were fine. Maybe microaggressions happened, but I didn't really notice 
because I grew up in a white household. 

As a nurse, the racism floodgates were opened. This was really my first time interacting with strangers in the community on a 
regular basis. And as I started meeting more people out of college, the microaggressions became more apparent. I was appalled 
at some overt racist remarks. The microaggressions... I'll cover those later. Here's an abbreviated list: 

1. Gook, Chink, (insert another slur here), etc...
2. "Can you speak English?" They said this to me, a nurse in scrubs working in the whitest community hospital. I would've liked to 
respond with "probably better than you." But of course, there are patient satisfaction scores!
3. "Where are you from? Where are you REALLY from?" To be covered later...
4. "I slept with women who looked like you in the war."
5. "Go back to your country."
6. Refusing care from a non-white nurse in which I was like byeeeeeee


# Microaggressions

Microaggressions are things that people say or do, and they may or may not realize it's racist. It may seem benign on the surface or even 
pass in some social situations, but the foundation of that microaggression is racism. This is my metaphor for microaggressions. Imagine 
your resilience and tolerance is a very large sink. The faucet for this sink has a little leak and drips a little bit here and there. 
Eventually the drips fill up the sink, and the sink spills over.
