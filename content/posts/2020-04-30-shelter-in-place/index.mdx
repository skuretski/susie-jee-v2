# Sheltering-in-place, feeling scared and angry

Over a month ago, we started shelter-in-place due to coronavirus. Around that time, I was pretty anxious. I was worried about loved ones, 
health care workers, getting coronavirus, job security, going back to working as a nurse, and how the federal & state governments were 
going (or not going to) respond. I would get angry at people who posted about health care, epidemiology, and public health policy 
when they clearly didn't have any background or education on the matter, and they "read an article or 'study' on the Internet." Everyone was quickly 
becoming an expert in public health, epidemiology, politics, law, and Constitutional rights without any regards to the words "peer reviewed" 
or "statistical analysis." Also, the words "toxins", "conspiracy", "natural", or any other pseudo (unfounded) science words would just set me 
right off too. FWIW: I am not an expert in any of these areas either. In fact, the more I learn in my field of computer science, the more I 
realize how ignorant I am. This is why we have studied professionals in their respective fields who have dedicated their entire professional life to 
study these topics along with their peers to question methods and results.

I was losing sleep or not sleeping well. I would pour over Twitter, statistics, projection models, and the CDC until late night/early morning 
hours. The more I consumed, the more I could feel the tension everywhere. My body was telling me it was unhealthy, but I was behaving like 
an addict. Thirsty for more information, studies, opinion pieces, and projections. Unfortunately, some of those things I read probably were 
incorrect, skewed, changed with new information, or didn't paint the whole picture. In reality, no one really knew anything. And no one really 
knows much to this day. 


# A month later

I kicked the habit of pouring over Twitter and other sites. I limit browsing time a lot. Facebook included. If I want to get tilted or troll, I'll 
just hop into a competitive video game, thanks. I have been sleeping a lot better. When did I turn a corner? When I realized I would control what I can 
do instead of what others do. I'm staying home, wearing a mask when out in public (which is basically never), washing my hands, 
and taking care of myself. Of course, you should take care of yourself, you say. But there are multiple factors to this idea:

1. Preventative health. With health systems under stress, I should take care of myself the best I can to decrease the chances I need medical care. 
2. Well-being. Physical and mental well-being will help me get through stressful times. Also, this will help me with the mental endurance needed for school. 
3. Worrying about your own damn self. Why should I waste my energy worrying about people when they are adults and I cannot control what they do? It sounds selfish, but I've had compassion fatigue from nursing and just life. Boundaries, boundaries, boundaries.

# Things I did that helped (in no particular order)

1. Limit browsing time
2. Buy an exercise bike and try Peloton's free 90 day trial app (which is great)
3. Concentrate on school and skills that will help me land a job even in a recession (software developers are getting laid off too)
4. Cook and bake new things 
5. Play Animal Crossing and Final Fantasy VII Remake
6. Spend time with Andrew and the dog child
7. Cleaned out our Room of Requirement for a home office for Andrew 
8. Review finances and make plans 
9. Providing financial assistance to people who need it

# Realizing my privilege, recognizing others' paths, helping out where I can

This post is so full of privilege! I am so thankful me and Andrew can mostly operate normally for now, but others definitely 
do not have the luxury. Not everyone can manage their stress with a new exercise bike or a Nintendo Switch. Not everyone 
can work from home. Not everyone is employed right now. Not everyone is healthy right now. Not everyone can have their voices 
heard. Not everyone will survive this virus.

What am I doing from this comfortable place? Donating. Donating. Donating.

Donating to relief funds, buying products from small businesses, and political campaigns.

# Vote!

This next election will be monumental. I urge you to be informed and vote. The best way to help people who can't stand up for 
themselves because they're too busy making minimum wage and trying to survive is to help get their voices heard and support 
candidates who position themselves to help everyday people. You may not find an ideal candidate, but we need to move forward. 
No longer one step forward and five steps back. We need change for the many who are not the top 5% of income earners. We 
need better health care for everyone. This pandemic has only intensified what we already needed. Vote.
