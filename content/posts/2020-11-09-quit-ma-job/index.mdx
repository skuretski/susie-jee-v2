As the title says, I quit my job today. I've been back and forth on it for some time. This year has been difficult for me 
to concentrate on grad school and work... and all the other things going on in 2020. I don't have Attention Deficit Disorder, 
but I feel like there is a hint of it. I've also been anxious and depressed. The most recent events have lifted a good amount 
of that anxiousness and anger away, but it's not all gone. But I won't go into that here. That is for a whole different post. 

Why did I quit?

## 2020 stress
I think this speaks for itself.

## Focusing on grad school
I don't mean to toot my own horn, but maybe I am. I am surviving a top-five graduate school for computer science - UIUC. With a 
34-year-old brain, I might add. My math skills are just not what they were at 18-22 years old. When I have to look up basic 
probability and linear algebra, I inwardly (or outwardly) weep and say "How the hell did I get into this program? I am a fraud." Hello, impostor syndrome. It 
plagues many in computer science, data science, and STEM. It especially plagues people who are not white 
men because you have to do it better (this is another discussion).

Granted, I was working part-time and it was somewhat doable, but do you ever just feel like you're in a grindy autopilot 
unable to come up for air where tired just becomes your norm? I'm not ICU night shift tired by any means. But my mind 
feels restless, chaotic, and fragmented.

## Searching for purpose in professional work
You might say I'm very millennial for this, but I truly want to work on projects that will move health care forward. My 
ultimate career goal is to improve health care for providers AND combat racism and bias in machine learning. These two things 
are what drove me into computer science from nursing in the first place. My now past job seemed to help insurance companies 
more than bedside providers. I felt like a hypocrite, selling out to "The Man." Maybe in the long run it will help providers.
I'm not sure, but at the present, I cannot deny how I feel about it.

## Cost/Benefit ratio
I joined the company when I knew things were difficult for them due to pandemic and economy, so my pay was much lower than market 
rate. I was/am grateful to them for hiring me when they were technically in a hiring freeze and allowing me to work part-time. 
Over time, I looked at the cost-benefit ratio. It was close, but in the end, I think my mental health and room to breathe will 
be worth it. 

## House stuff
I would like to have energy to cook and clean the house. Lately it's been pretty low. I know it doesn't have to be perfect, 
but it wears on my mental well-being when things are unorganized and meals are mediocre. I also want to explore cooking 
different meals and baking tarts like Mary Berry. No soggy bottoms.

## The privilege here is like whoa...
I am so very grateful we can get by without me working. Every day I try to identify my privileges, be grateful for them, and 
ask how I can use them for service. For now, I feel like I'm arming myself with the knowledge to be part of the force to 
raise questions and discussions about bias in data science and machine learning. I want to take down systemic racism in health care. 
To. The. Ground.
