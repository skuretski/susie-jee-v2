## My first post using Gatsby and Narative's Novela Theme

Huge shout out to [Narative](https://www.narative.co/) and their [Gatsby Novela Theme](https://github.com/narative/gatsby-theme-novela).
It's been fun making my own personal touches on a theme that caught my eye for its minimalist design and light-dark mode.

Like many developers who have a trail of past personal sites, blogs, and domains, my blogging journey started when I was a nurse. I used Wordpress, and I had a rudimentary grasp on CSS and HTML. I wrote about nurse things and life lessons. When I started my computer science degree, I felt some shame in that my personal blog was in Wordpress and that it wasn't built from the ground up.
So, I wrote an entire site using a very early version of React, Node.js, and Postgres. I ported over my Wordpress posts to it and even made a way to insert new posts quickly. Over time, this felt heavy. It was not quick nor easy. I didn't implement analytics or email. It felt incomplete, but I didn't want to continue this trudge. Eventually, this site decayed.

After attending a Chrome Dev Summit, I heard about Gatsby. It seemed like a quick, performant way to spin up a blog quickly. I used the original [Gatsby Blog Starter](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog/tree/master) in early 2019, but I really wanted something that looked a bit more designed (without the severe elbow grease). As more themes popped in the Gatsby community, I found Narative.

### Pros

1. Uses MDX over plain markdown
2. Getting a light dive into Contentful
3. Clear instructions on how to start quickly right out of the box
4. Continuing support (as of fall 2019)
### Cons

1. Customizing components requires component shadowing, which is powerful once you realize what it can do. It just took me a bit of time to figure it out. Also, figuring out the color overrides took a chunk of time even with the docs in front of my face. 

Overall, I think it's a great theme that takes a bit of time personalize, but once you do, it feels quick, modern, and easy to roll with. I'm really glad to see the Gatsby community heat up. 

Looking forward to posting about code, data science, games, and everything in between!
