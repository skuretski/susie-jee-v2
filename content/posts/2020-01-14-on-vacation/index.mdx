## On Vacation & Acaedmic Probation
We're on our first vacation as a married couple and since 2017. Would this be considered our honeymoon? 
The last vacation we took was to South Haven, Michigan. It was a five-day low budget vacation where we stayed at 
a bed-and-breakfast. I had just graduated from Oregon State with my bachelor's in computer science. It was a much needed 
vacation. Much like this current vacation. VERY MUCH NEEDED.

### Academic probation
After last semester, I have earned my place on academic probation for my B- (2.67) in the class. Academic probation 
occurs if your cumulative GPA falls belong 3.0 and/or you earn less than 2.75 for the semester.
While I don't deny I belong there, last semester was 
particularly brutal. I could barely keep up with work, school, house, husband, and dog. I actually calculated how many spare 
hours I had a week: 47 hours. Let's see this calculation for 168 hours in a week: 
  * 45 hours of work
  * 20 hours of school
  * 56 hours of sleep

This means I had 47 hours a week to commute, shower, clean, cook, laundry, manage bills and finance, take care of the dog, 
talk to husband, grocery shop, and maybe talk to other human beings. 

UIUC says classes take roughly 10-20 hours a week for a class. Well, for me, that is incredibly under. In order to get an 
A in my class would've taken me 40 hours a week. I allocated 20 hours a week to listen to lecture, re-listen to lecture, 
pick away at homework problems, and write programming assignments. There was a textbook which might've been helpful, 
but I couldn't even put that into the budget. This pattern of needing more time for school than what the school recommended 
also held true for me in my undergraduate CS program. It took me longer than their recommended time to really absorb the material, 
but I graduated with a 3.9 GPA. 

### Feeling like an idiot
I can't help but think that I'm a slow learning idiot. I know it's not true, but in a class of 500 students, I probably 
got one of the lowest grades on the final (only speculation - no exam grades or solutions were released). It doesn't 
feel great. I was actually doing well-ish (A-/B+) until the final. This degree is going to be my acaedmic Everest. 
And I'm beginning to doubt my 33-year-old mind. Am I too old? Am I too slow? Has it been too long since I had this kind 
of academic rigor? Is data science even for me? Should I just hang it up? 
***Welcome to my self-pity party of first-world problems.***

### Current situation
Vacation has been great. Most days are spent with Andrew listening to Critical Role by the pool with a pina colada, 
and I'm reading fiction. I brought the textbook for my next class, but haven't opened it. Maybe I'll regret it later. 
I feel a tinge of guilt for not getting ahead on school work, but deep down I know that's insane. I've been having a hard 
time relaxing 100%. The palms trees, drinks, and spending quality time with my husband has been invaluable, not to mention 
the warm weather while Chicago is 20 degrees.

### Thinking about gender roles
1. By speculation, my first graduate level CS class had ~18% women. I looked at the class list of online students and 
assigned them a gender (binarily). Some students had a profile picture which made this rough assignment somewhat easier. I did look 
online by Google searching names. With some names, I could not draw a conclusion, so I skipped them. The others were confirmed 
students of the class by their LinkedIn profiles with course certificates along with either a profile picture or a LinkedIn 
recommendation stating their pronouns.<br/><br/>I **strongly** dislike my method of assigning gender because:
1) it does not account a person's own stated preference of gender or non-gender and
2) it is only binary which is not great.
I did this because I wanted a rough estimate of people identifying as women in the class. My results were following the 
current trends of women in CS. Women graduating from undergraduate computer science majors is roughly 
[18%](https://www.computerscience.org/resources/women-in-computer-science/).

2. My husband is one of the most feminist men I have ever met, otherwise, I would not have married him. I also define
feminism as advocating for women's rights in terms of meeting equality for all.

3. At times, I do feel like the "primary caregiver" of our household. A good chunk of that is because I 
take control of most things because I'm so risk averse. Failure to plan is a plan to fail. I'm also a perfectionist. 
This spills over into things like cleaning, cooking, and finance. I often feel like I have a 
thousands of daemon (background) processes running to keep track of things with my main process being the present task. 
Sometimes it's maddening. Are we low on dog food? Did I pay rent? Are the 401ks surviving? The bathroom needs cleaning.
What should I cook for dinner? What do we need on our next grocery shopping trip? 
Is that thing on the hamper clean or dirty? ... Oh back, to studying. I'm going to go on a limb and say some women might 
feel like this too.<br/><br/>I've been working on letting some things go. Living life in a perfect picture is not sustainable. 
It's hard and energy sucking.<br/><br/>We have also been working on sharing responsibilities. I need to let go. He needs to take hold. It's 
a delicate balance which won't always be 50/50. We can strive for a 50/50 split of household responsibilities, but I know 
life flows like the tide. It's not always going to be equal. 

4. Could this be one of the many barriers for women in CS, any other advanced degree, or career progression? I would say yes.
It's hard to let go of so many house responsibilities. I want our family to succeed. I find it a loaded question for successful 
women to get asked "How do you have it all? What are your tips to _have it all_?" First, do men get asked the specific 
_have it all_ question? Maybe, but rarely. Having it all means family, career, education, and a social network. To _have it all_ 
sacrifices are made, and you have to have a very supportive person in your life, whether they're a spouse, family member, 
friend, nanny, or therapist. Or some combination of all of those.

### Future situation
I'm not sure what the future holds, and quite frankly, I am extremely demoralized with being on academic probation. 65% of 
me wants to conquer it zealously, and the other 35% wants to just curl up, hide, and withdraw from the program. 
What I do know is that last term was stressful, not maintainable, and is not the life I want. Nobody on their death bed 
says they wished they worked more, hustled more, and spent less time with their loved ones. I'm very thankful for this 
vacation and spending time with Andrew. It was perfectly timed.
