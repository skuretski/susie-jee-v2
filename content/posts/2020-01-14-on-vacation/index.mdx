# On Vacation & Acaedmic Probation -- Don't call me
We're on our first vacation as a married couple and since 2017. The last vacation we took was to South Haven, Michigan. 
It was a five-day low budget vacation where we stayed at a bed-and-breakfast. I had just graduated from Oregon State with 
my bachelor's in computer science. It was a much needed vacation. Much like this current vacation. VERY MUCH NEEDED. 

## Academic probation
After last semester, I have earned my place on academic probation. While I don't deny I belong there, last semester was 
particularly brutal. I could barely keep up with work, school, house, husband, and dog. I actually calculated how many spare 
hours I had a week: 47 hours. Let's see this calculation: 

* 168 hours a week
  * 45 hours of work
  * 20 hours of school
  * 56 hours of sleep

This means I had 47 hours a week to commute, shower, clean, cook, laundry, manage bills and finance, take care of the dog, 
talk to husband, grocery shop, and maybe talk to other human beings. 

UIUC says classes take roughly 10-20 hours a week for a class. Well, for me, that is incredibly under. In order to get an 
A in CS425 would've taken me 40 hours a week. 20 hours a week was allocated to listening to lecture, re-listening to lecture, 
picking away at homework problems, and programming assignments. There was a textbook which might've been helpful, 
but I couldn't even put that into the budget. 

## Feeling like an idiot
I can't help but think that I'm a slow learning idiot. I know it's not true, but in a class of 500 students, I probably 
got one of the lowest grades on the final (only speculation - no exam grades or solutions were released). It doesn't 
feel great. This degree is going to be my acaedmic Everest. And I'm beginning to doubt my 33-year-old mind. Am I too old? 
Am I too slow? Has it been too long since I had this kind of academic rigor? Is data science even for me? 
Welcome to my self-pity party of first-world problems. 

## Current situation
Vacation has been great. Most days are spent with Andrew listening to Critical Role by the pool with a pina colada, 
and I'm reading fiction. I brought the textbook for my next class, but haven't opened it. Maybe I'll regret it later. 
I feel a tinge of guilt for not getting ahead on school work, but deep down I know that's insane. I've been having a hard 
time relaxing 100%. The palms trees, drinks, and spending non-rushed time with my husband has been invaluable, not to mention 
the warm weather while Chicago is 20 degrees.

## Gender roles
1. By speculation, my CS class had the normal ratio of women and men in computer science. From looking at the student list 
and active users on the forums, that is my rough estimate. Also, the normal ratio is not great.

2. My husband is one of the most feminist men I have ever met.

3. At times, I do feel like the "primary caregiver" of our household. A good chunk of that is because I 
take control of most things because I'm so risk averse. Failure to plan is a plan to fail. I'm also a perfectionist. 
This spills over into things like cleaning, cooking, and finance. I often feel like I have a 
thousands of daemon (background) processes running to keep track of things with my main process being the present task. 
Sometimes it's maddening. Are we low on dog food? Did I pay rent? Are the 401ks surviving? The bathroom needs cleaning.
What should I cook for dinner? Is that thing on the hamper clean or dirty? ...Oh back, to studying. I'm going to go on a limb
and say some women might feel like this too. 

I've been working on letting some things go. Living life in a perfect picture is not sustainable. It's hard. 

We have also been working on sharing responsibilities. I need to let go. He needs to take hold. It's a delicate balance 
which won't always be 50/50. We can strive for a 50/50 split of household responsibilities, but I know life flows like 
the tide. It's not always going to be equal. 

## Future situation
I'm not sure what the future holds.
