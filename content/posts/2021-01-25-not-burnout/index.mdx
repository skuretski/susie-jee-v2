excerpt: It's not clinician burnout. It's clinician abuse.

It's my first post of 2021. It's already felt like a long year between insurrections and inaugurations. We're in the thick 
of COVID-19 despite what others are thinking and doing. In fact, what everyone was scared about last year is actually coming 
to fruition, but yet many are YOLO-ing this virus and doing whatever they want. Bars, restaurants, family gatherings, 
schools, travel, and businesses are trying to operate "normally." And I get the reason behind trying to regain this normalcy in terms of 
financial, social, and mental health reasons. But for God's sake, our health care system is at breaking point. What happened to 
the "Heroes Work Here" and support of healthcare workers in spring 2020? Also, the whole "Heroes Work Here" is a nice facade 
for "We call them heroes because we actually abuse the shit out of them so their dedication to patients is heroic." 

The term "clinician burnout" has always irritated me to no end. It implies the clinician has failed. They 
could not keep their flame alive. They burned out. They are weak. But in fact, it's the system that has failed them. It's 
the administration that has failed them. Dealing with terrible staffing ratios, shortage of supplies and PPE, time sunk into 
handholding management, and the "do more with less" mentality would make any clinician question their resolve to a profession 
they chose to help people. What it should be called is clinician abuse. 

Hospital administration bank on health care providers' innate sense of duty and empathy to patients and coworkers. You 
receive a call from the hospital at 2pm after you've worked your third night shift in a row: "Can you work tonight? 
We're so short-staffed. Everyone is drowning. I might be able to get you bonus." This messaging is probably correct. The 
unit is probably drowning between acuity and density. You know what it's like to be terribly short staffed because 
you've been there. You left in the morning knowing it would be terrible that night. You feel bad for your coworkers and 
the patients you've gotten to know. You feel guilty if you left them high and dry. So you say yes. In the short term, it 
might be fine to push yourself through the exhaustion, but over time it adds up. The grind. The stress. The sleep deprivation. 
The unsaid emotions of what you've seen. But admin doesn't care. They just want a warm body with a license.

I left bedside nursing a few years ago. I ran away and did look back. When the pandemic broke out, I felt a huge sense of 
guilt. I should be helping because I'm able to help. I can work a ventilator, titrate drips, and paralyze and prone. The thing 
that paralyzed me is that I knew exactly what those working conditions would be: short-staffed, inadequate equipment, and essentially 
the middle person in a 10-ring circus. I did not want to go back to that. And I felt that guilt. Most people would say you 
have to do what's best for you and stick to your boundaries. I did, but the sense of guilt is still there. Even today, I 
have nightmares about past or fictional ICU situations. 

In tech, I see things like _Digital Solutions to Combat Clinician Burnout Epidemic._ Okkkkk. What we actually need to help "clinician 
burnout" are better benefits, pay, PTO, mental health support, and truly adequate staffing ratios. If you're trying to throw a 
digital solution at this, it better be damn good and not some application to make documentation "easier."

Maybe you think I'm being outlandish for calling it clinician abuse. Maybe you think I'm being entirely one-sided and biased. 
Maybe I am. But I do know clinicians are tired and weary. This pandemic has put them at breaking point, which I'm sure they 
were close to even before this pandemic due to work conditions like assault, violence, stress, and long hours. The whole 
kicker to this is that one of my past places of employment tried to spin it as nurses were too entitled. Like hell.
