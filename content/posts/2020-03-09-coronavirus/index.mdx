I have been out of bedside nursing for almost 3 years. And I have been following what's been going on with COVID-19. While 
I'm far from being an expert in infectious diseases or epidemiology, I do believe I can draw some conclusions on what's going 
on based on past insights on the U.S. health care system and various sources like the CDC, WHO, and other organizations that 
aren't Fox News. 

## You might be okay, but at-risk populations will suffer the most
Sure, you might be healthy, have insurance coverage, and probably could survive COVID-19. Maybe you even have the ability 
to work from home to decrease your risk of spreading or contracting it. In the United States, however, the low income, un-insured 
and under-insured, elderly, and immune compromised people are going to get hit the hardest. First, low income families typically 
have poor or no insurance coverage, no sick time from work, and are struggling to make ends meet. Often times, it's a choice 
between food or health care. If they contract COVID-19, seeking medical care may be avoided due to lack of adequate coverage, and 
then the virus could go undetected and untreated. 

Second, in un-insured or under-insured populations, they are likely not to seek care quickly with respiratory symptoms. "Maybe 
it's a cold? Maybe it's just the flu? Surely I didn't contract coronavirus. I'm sure it'll be fine in a day or two." Why do I 
think this is going to happen? Because it already happens with chest pain, CHF, pneumonia, and COPD exacerbation. Why would it be 
different? Hospital bills in full without assistance are insane and broken. It's a sad reality that people avoid bankruptcy and bills at 
the cost of their lives. 

Third, the elderly and immune compromised are the most vulnerable populations in contracting the virus. As seen by China and Italy, 
the mortality rate is higher. While this is similar to most other disease patterns, it's not an excuse to dismiss it. Yes, thank you for 
reminding me that influenza kills people each year. Yes, thank you for pointing out that people die from gun shot wounds and car 
accidents. Yes, thank you for reminding me that people die. The point is that we should not dismiss it. And you're an asshole if 
you do dismiss a 1-4% mortality rate because it's "low." Statistics are statistics, but have some humanity and compassion. Those 
statistics can quickly become your reality. 

## The thing I'm concerned about
We are under-testing. I know not everyone walking into an ER, immediate care, or physician's office with respiratory 
symptoms are getting tested. The numbers in the United States are falsely too low. It feels like a sleeping giant waiting 
to be uncovered. 

## The thing I'm more concerned about
I'm not one for panic. As many know, I am a very methodical and science-based person. Statistics will soon be my livelihood in data 
science. While I do not support the fear feeding the media tends to do, I am concerned about COVID-19. Why? Because our U.S. health 
systems are not equipped to handle an acute respiratory epidemic. How do I know this? 
- Because we ran short on ventilators in regular influenza and pneumonia season
- Because we ran out of isolation gowns
- Because "rapid" flu tests sometimes took days to come back or they got lost
- Because our supply chain is slow and has a paradox of being too regulated and not regulated at the same time
- Because ER wait times are already atrocious
- Because regular, everyday care is a struggle

This may seem anecdotal, but I know it's not uncommon for hospitals to be under-equipped, under-staffed and under-prepared. 
Think about your encounters with health care. Then, think about your encounters with Amazon. Which encounter was more organized and 
stream-lined? 

## The thing I'm most concerned about
I hope and pray all the front line health care providers are given the proper equipment 
and resources to do their jobs. I left bedside with dire staffing ratios, and I often hunted for equipment. On some nights, it 
was like living a nightmare. And that was just a typical night in ICU. I can't imagine what an acute, rapidly spreading infection 
can do.

I also hope and pray providers don't contract it and end up tubed themselves. The scariest scenario happens 
when our front line goes down. Then what? Who takes care of the patients? Health care providers are already burned out. 
This is just putting gasoline on an already burning fire.
