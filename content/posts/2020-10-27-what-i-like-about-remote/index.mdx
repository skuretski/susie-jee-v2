# Things I like about working from home

- No commute. I don't have to squish onto a smelly bus on the CTA, where a seat might be covertly wet due to a sick passenger. 
My bus was always packed even during non-rush hours. I shudder at the thought of sardining onto a bus with COVID now.

- Comfy clothes. Joggers and sweatshirts are my go-to now like many other people. Business casual can GTFO, and I'm getting rid 
of all my business casual clothes I needed for my last job. My disdain for business casual is known. I will never take a job where 
I can't wear my cat t-shirt. I JUST WON'T! 

- Bypassing winter. I don't have to boot up, sleeping bag coat up, and bundle for the winter. I would wear leggings and pants, warm socks, 
my long down coat that looks like a sleeping bag, wool scarf, two pairs of gloves, and boots. Then, I would have to store all that 
shit at my desk. Thanks, but I'll pass.

- Sub-zero office temperatures. My old office was ALWAYS freezing. I hated it. I had hand warmers, a blanket, a shawl, and plenty of tea. 
I did have a contraband space heater, but I only used it once because one night before going to sleep I was paranoid I left it on and 
burned down the whole office. So Andrew, the dog, and I took drove to the office at midnight to check that it was off. It was. But that 
was the last time I ever wanted a space heater at work.

- Going to the bathroom in peace. Let's face it ladies. There is an unsaid rule that if someone is sitting quietly in the stall next to you 
it means you should hurry TF up and get out because they need to do their business. Now that I'm at home there is no bathroom rule 
following.

- Lunch time. I used to buy lunch most days like most people in the Loop. It added up quickly. Now, I take lunch, cook
something, do some laundry, shower, or play with the dog. 

- Sleeping in. I wake up at about 9am now. I don't set an alarm. It's glorious.

- Dinner prep. I can seamlessly close laptop lid and start prepping dinner, and I usually don't feel completely exhausted and drained 
from work and a commute. I guess this goes back to no commute. But it's also easy to start marinading or letting bread proof during the 
work day, which is something I never got to do before. 


I know not everyone's work-from-home situation is like mine. Some people have kids and are trying to fill multiple roles, while also 
trying to be attentive to work. Some people don't have the option to work-from-home and are forced to go to work, which increases 
their risk of exposure to COVID. Some people are struggling to find a job and/or health insurance coverage. And some people are 
just confirming an illegitimate Supreme Court justice. Props to everyone trying to make it work! Except Senate Republicans. Those 
hypocrites can go somewhere where the sun don't shine. 

Thanks for reading a very vanilla take on my likeness for work-from-home.
