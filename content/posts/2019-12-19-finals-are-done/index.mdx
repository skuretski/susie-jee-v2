## Finals finally done

It *finally* happened. I finished my first graduate level CS class at University of Illinois. It was a bumpy journey.

I took Distributed Systems at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, taught by Indy Gupta. The class itself had about 
500 students with a mix of upper-level undergraduates on-campus, on-campus thesis-seeking graduate students, and online Coursera students.
