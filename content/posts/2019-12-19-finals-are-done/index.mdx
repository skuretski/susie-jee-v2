## Finals finally done

It *finally* happened. I finished my first graduate level CS class at University of Illinois. It was a bumpy journey.

I took Distributed Systems at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, taught by Indy Gupta. The class itself had about 
500 students with a mix of upper-level undergraduates on-campus, on-campus thesis-seeking graduate students, and online Coursera students. 
The content was heavy and mostly theoretical. I have been out of formal academia for about 2 years, and I wasn't sure if it felt difficult because I have grown rusty 
or because the material was considerably difficult, or both. I believe I maintained an A until the very end... the final. The final was very difficult and proof heavy. I left some questions blank despite the 3 1/2 hour time allotted. 

My perfectionist self was/is very demoralized by this. I try to rationalize that I'm working 40+ hours a week (but who's counting) and
trying to lead a team to push for the application's market validation. The past few months have been wrought with stress, shingle tingle, exhaustion, 
less than ideal diet, and tears. 
## What I learned from nursing

In your 20's generally, you think you have all the time in the world. Death is so far removed. But I witnessed a good amount of people 
die when I worked in intensive care. While it was difficult to process sometimes, a good thing to come out of witnessing that is entering the mindset
of "Life is short. Any day can really be your last." Now as I contemplate this hustle reality that could persist until I'm done with school, I'm 
really contemplating priorities. I hope with the time off from work and school I can find some clarity. Something has to give, but what will it be?
