## Stepping away from a full-time salary

My last post lamented about grad school, not having enough time, and too many things to 
juggle with a sprinkle of thoughts regarding feminism. Since then, I have lightened the load with some cuts. I have moved to a 
part-time role at my same company. However, I have forfeited my team lead role, a good chunk of my salary, and benefits. I 
recognize the privilege of the choice and ability to do this and am incredibly thankful to my supportive husband. While we're 
behind in retirement, still have student loans to pay off, and have current tuition for my schooling, we are choosing 
to invest in education. I'm hoping that I can survive this top-tier graduate school to more firmly secure a future for us. 
Of course, like any millennial, I think no future is secure. But that's another post with many words...

## What my non-work days are like

My non-work days are not glamorous. I am not in a cute coffee shop studying. I am not sleeping in. I drag my ass out of bed, sit behind 
a computer for 8-10 hours a day, shower as a break, and still struggle to keep the house tasks afloat. The constant 
pressure of getting above 88% so I don't get kicked out is always looming. I am encouraged and humbled by people believing in me. 
But I always think "Is this the time I fail?" I'm usually so determined, but this program has really tested my resolve. 

## Feeling old 

The last serious math course I took was back in 2005 at IWU as a prereq for my nursing degree. I did take statistics and 
discrete math online before enrolling in my undergraduate computer science program, but they were not even close to the rigor 
of UIUC. Now, I feel like a dinosaur trying to remember linear algebra, statistics, and calculus. I usually feel a bit old 
when at work with coworkers born in the 90's or interns born in the 2000's, but my mathematics slowness makes me just 
feel like a rusty bucket struggling to hold water. 

## Much complain, much wow

Yeah, I feel like I'm complaining, and it's not my favorite. Mostly, it's because I feel like it's hard to communicate the 
difficulty of this journey. I consider this my academic Everest. While I wish to climb it with a great attitude and 
positivity, it's hard to get into that mindset with this fear of falling. 

If you've made it this far in reading, thank you. Have a good day.
